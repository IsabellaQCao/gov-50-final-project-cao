## Project thoughts

While I'm definitely not settled on a topic, an area that I would be interested 
in exploring is civic engagement and political beliefs across demographics. In
particular, I was considering how exposure to a liberal arts education affected
voter registration across fields of study or how different factors affect
naturalization, voter registration, and political leaning of immigrants.
